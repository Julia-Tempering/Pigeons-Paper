\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

We introduce a software package, Pigeons.jl, that provides a way to leverage distributed computation to 
obtain samples from complicated probability distributions, such as 
multimodal posteriors arising in Bayesian inference and high-dimensional 
distributions in statistical mechanics. Pigeons.jl provides simple APIs to 
perform such computations single-threaded, multi-threaded,
and/or distributed over thousands of MPI-communicating machines.
In addition, Pigeons.jl guarantees a property that we call strong parallelism invariance: the 
output for a given seed is identical irrespective of the number of threads and processes, 
which is crucial for scientific reproducibility and software validation. 
We describe the key features of Pigeons.jl and the approach taken to implement 
a distributed and randomized algorithm that satisfies strong parallelism invariance.
